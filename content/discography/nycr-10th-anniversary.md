I have had the great pleasure of running National Youth Choir's in-house record label, [National Youth Choir Recordings](https://www.nationalyouthchoir.org.uk/recordings) since 2022. Over this time, it has been fantastic to see it develop into a high-quality, respected label in its own right, producing dozens of releases and millions of streams every year.

Since its inception in 2014 (first releasing in 2015), we have had the privilege to work with many great composers, ensembles and artists, including the likes of Eric Whitacre, Roxanna Panufnik, Errollyn Wallen, The King's Singers, Central Band of the RAF, The Swingles, Ben Parry, Ellie Slorach, and so many more. And of course, thousands of young singers have had the opportunity to experience the marvel that is participating in a recording session.

Our recordings have been broadcast on radio and television around the world, are consistently featured on the streaming platform's editorial playlists, and have received rave reviews from organisations including Gramophone and BBC Music Magazine.

We wanted to create something truly special to mark the NYCR's 10th anniversary, celebrating all the amazing people that have worked on, for and with the label over the past decade.

I had the great privilege of curating this project, including planning its content, running interviews with our guests, and co-editing the film. Please do give it a watch, as I'm sure you'll agree that it's a truly lovely video.

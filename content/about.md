Josh Quinlan is a British audio producer & baritone. He maintains a busy schedule of freelance recording and performance work, and runs both [Endelium Records](https://endelium.com) (an independent classical record label and music distribution company) and National Youth Choir's in-house record label, [National Youth Choir Recordings](https://www.nationalyouthchoir.org.uk/recordings).

He specialises in working with choirs, vocal ensembles, and soloists, with a particular passion for recording new music. His production style is defined by clarity, depth, and a naturalistic sound that captures the emotional immediacy of performance while preserving the acoustic integrity of the space. He is also a firm believer in artist-centred sessions - creating a friendly, positive environment where creativity, collaboration and enjoyment is allowed to flourish. As a performer-producer, he brings a rare dual perspective to the studio, enabling him to communicate with artists effectively and support them in achieving recordings of exceptional nuance and quality.

Josh was born with a rare condition called Oculocutaneous Albinism, and has been registered blind since birth. He first trained at the [Royal Northern College of Music](https://rncm.ac.uk)’s Junior Department, studying Singing, Conducting, Composition, Clarinet (with a focus on Bass Clarinet), and Advanced Musicology. During his time there, he received several awards for Composition and was honoured with the Percy Welton Prize for Academic Music.

He is presently a Conducting Fellow on the National Youth Choir's Emerging Professional Artists programme, and also works with them as an audio producer and section coach. In parallel, he has composed award-winning works for numerous institutions and ensembles, including [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern), the [Royal Liverpool Philharmonic](https://liverpoolphil.com) (with whom he was a Composer on their Rushworth scheme between 2016 and 2018), the Wilfred Owen Commemoration Festival, and mezzo-soprano [Jennifer Johnston](https://www.jenniferjohnstonmezzo.com/).

At age 18, Josh made his conducting debut at the [Royal Albert Hall](https://www.royalalberthall.com), performing his own music with musicians from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. In 2023, he was selected for the prestigious [Glyndebourne](https://www.glyndebourne.com/) [Academy](https://www.glyndebourne.com/take-part/glyndebourne-academy/), receiving mentorship as a young vocal soloist with exceptional potential.
